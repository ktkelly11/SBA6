# MongoDB Server

## The Idea

The assignment was given to create a server using node server and since my darling rescue dog has been one of my largest cheerleaders while taking this course, I thought it only fitting to finally make a project inspired by her!

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to work properly:

- JavaScript
- Express and Node
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

This is in a public repository on GitHub.

## Development
