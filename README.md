# MongoDB Database Application

## The Idea

The assignment was given to create a database application using MongoDB or Mongoose, and since my darling rescue dog has been one of my largest comforts and supports while taking this course (she has heard plenty of rants about how I can't make it and let me cry on her when I have struggled), I thought it only fitting to finally make a project inspired by her!

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to work properly:

- JavaScript
- Express and Node
- Mongoose

- I used the SAAP website (where I got Harper) as a point of reference for naming pets and getting their info (https://www.adoptastray.com/)

This is in a public repository on GitHub.
