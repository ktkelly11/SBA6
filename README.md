# MongoDB Server

## The Idea

The assignment was given to create a server using MongoDB or Mongoose, and since my darling rescue dog has been one of my largest comforts and supports (she has heard plenty of rants about how I can't make it and let me cry on her when I have struggled) while taking this course, I thought it only fitting to finally make a project inspired by her!

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to work properly:

- JavaScript
- Express and Node
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

This is in a public repository on GitHub.
